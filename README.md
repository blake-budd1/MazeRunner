#MazeRunner - Comparison of Graph traversal algorithms

C++ program using SFML graphics library to illustrate the different speeds of graph traversal algorithms.
Included the ability to compare two algorithms at the same time using multithreading as well as seeing both algorithms work in real time.
Inlcudes: Dijkstra's algorithm, breadth-first search, and depth-first search.
